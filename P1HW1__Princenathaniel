# Assignment Name: Mathematical Expressions Program
# A brief description of the project: This program takes user input to calculate the result of a base raised to an exponent 
# and performs addition and subtraction with three separate integers.

# Step 1: Prompt the user to enter the base and exponent
base = int(input("Enter the base number: "))
exponent = int(input("Enter the exponent: "))

# Calculate the result of base raised to the power of exponent
power_result = base ** exponent

# Display the result
print(f"{base} raised to the power of {exponent} is {power_result}!")

# Step 2: Prompt the user to enter three separate integers
num1 = int(input("\nEnter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
num3 = int(input("Enter the third number: "))

# Perform the addition and subtraction operations
sum_result = num1 + num2
final_result = sum_result - num3

# Display the result
print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} minus {num3} is {final_result}!")
