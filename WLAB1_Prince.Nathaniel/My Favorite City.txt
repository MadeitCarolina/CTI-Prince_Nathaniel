    <p>
        Charlotte, North Carolina, was founded in 1768 and named in honor of Queen Charlotte of England. It played a pivotal role during the American Revolutionary War, earning the nickname "The Hornet's Nest" due to its fierce resistance to British forces. In the 19th century, it became a hub for gold mining, sparking the first U.S. gold rush. Today, Charlotte is a major financial center, home to several Fortune 500 companies.
