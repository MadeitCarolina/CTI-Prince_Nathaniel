# A brief description of the project: This program allows the user to enter their budget, travel destination, and expenses for gas, 
# accommodation, and food. It calculates the total expenses, subtracts them from the budget, and displays the remaining amount or 
# the overspent value along with the travel destination.
# Pseudocode: The pseudocode outlines each step in a logical, structured way, making it clear how the program processes user input 
# and performs calculations. It serves as a blueprint for the program and can be helpful for understanding the logic before implementing it in Python.
#
# Pseudocode:
# 1. Prompt the user to enter their budget and store it in a variable.
# 2. Prompt the user to enter their travel destination and store it in a variable.
# 3. Prompt the user to enter the amount they will spend on gas and store it in a variable.
# 4. Prompt the user to enter the amount they will spend on accommodation and store it in a variable.
# 5. Prompt the user to enter the amount they will spend on food and store it in a variable.
# 6. Calculate the total expenses by adding gas, accommodation, and food expenses.
# 7. Subtract the total expenses from the budget to calculate the remaining budget.
# 8. Display the destination, initial budget, total expenses, and the remaining budget in a user-friendly format.

# Step 3: Ask the user for their budget
budget = float(input("Enter your budget: "))

# Step 4: Ask the user for their travel destination
destination = input("Enter your travel destination: ")

# Step 5-7: Ask for gas, accommodation, and food expenses
gas_expense = float(input("Enter the amount you will spend on gas: "))
accommodation_expense = float(input("Enter the amount you will spend on accommodation: "))
food_expense = float(input("Enter the amount you will spend on food: "))

# Step 8: Add all expenses
total_expenses = gas_expense + accommodation_expense + food_expense

# Step 9: Subtract expenses from the budget
remaining_budget = budget - total_expenses

# Step 10: Display the results
print("\n------------ Travel Budget Summary ------------")
print(f"Destination: {destination}")
print(f"Initial Budget: ${budget:.2f}")
print(f"Total Expenses: ${total_expenses:.2f}")
print(f"Remaining Budget: ${remaining_budget:.2f}")
