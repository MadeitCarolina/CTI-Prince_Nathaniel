# Assignment Name: Grade Statistics
# Brief description of program:
# This program allows the user to input a series of grades, stores them in a list, 
# and calculates and displays the lowest grade, highest grade, sum of all grades, 
# and the average of the grades. The output is formatted for clarity.

# Pseudocode:
# 1. Create an empty list to store grades.
# 2. Prompt the user to enter the number of grades they will input.
# 3. Use a loop to collect grades from the user and append them to the list.
# 4. Calculate the lowest grade, highest grade, sum of grades, and average of grades.
# 5. Display the calculated statistics, formatted with two decimal places for the average.

# Create an empty list to store grades
grades_list = []

# Prompt user for the number of grades
num_grades = int(input("Enter the number of grades you will input: "))

# Collect grades from the user
print("\nEnter the grades:")
for i in range(num_grades):
    grade = float(input(f"Grade {i + 1}: "))
    grades_list.append(grade)

# Calculate statistics
lowest_grade = min(grades_list)
highest_grade = max(grades_list)
sum_of_grades = sum(grades_list)
average_grade = sum_of_grades / len(grades_list)

# Display statistics
print("\nGrade Summary")
print("-" * 20)
print(f"{'Lowest Grade:':<15} {lowest_grade:.2f}")
print(f"{'Highest Grade:':<15} {highest_grade:.2f}")
print(f"{'Sum of Grades:':<15} {sum_of_grades:.2f}")
print(f"{'Average:':<15} {average_grade:.2f}")
